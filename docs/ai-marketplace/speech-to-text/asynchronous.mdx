## Asynchronous Methods

Our Asynchronous Inference API allows you to create inference jobs using two methods: by uploading a file or by providing a pre-signed URL. After creating a job, you will receive a job_id to track its status and retrieve the result.

```mdx-code-block
import AsynchronousCard from '../../../src/components/AsynchronousCard';
import LinkCard from '../../../src/components/LinkCard';

<section style={{ display: "grid", gap: "1rem", gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fill,minmax(320px, 1fr))" }}>
  <AsynchronousCard
    Svg={require("@site/static/img/upload.svg").default}
    title={"Upload files"}
    description="Upload files directly to start an inference job. Once the file is processed, you'll receive a job_id to track the job."
    href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/asynchronous-api/uploading-file"}
  />
  <AsynchronousCard
    Svg={require("@site/static/img/upload-cloud.svg").default}
    title={"Submit Pre-signed URLs"}
    description={"Provide pre-signed URLs from a file upload service like AWS S3. The API will fetch and process the file, returning a job_id to track the job."}
    href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/asynchronous-api/pre-singed-url"}
  />
</section>
```

## Get Job Status by Job ID

Use the Job API to check the status of your inference jobs and retrieve the results once processing is complete.

```mdx-code-block
<LinkCard title={"Get Job Status API"}  href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/asynchronous-api/get-job-status"} />
```

---

## List All Jobs

Retrieve a list of all inference jobs that have been submitted.

```mdx-code-block
<LinkCard title={"List All Jobs"}  href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/asynchronous-api/list-jobs"} />
```

---

## Cancel Job

API allows you to cancel an inference job by submitting its job_id in the request body.

```mdx-code-block
<LinkCard title={"Cancel Job"}  href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/asynchronous-api/cancel-job"} />
```
