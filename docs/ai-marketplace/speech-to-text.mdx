# Speech To Text

The API is highly scalable and supports a range of audio formats. Developers can choose between two primary API options based on the length of the audio input and the use case:

## Synchronous API

Synchronous API returns the recognized text for short audio **(less than 5 minutes)**.

## Asynchronous API

Asynchronous API starts a long running audio processing operation. Use asynchronous API to transcribe audio that is **longer than 5 minutes**. The upper limit for asynchronous API is **300 minutes**.
