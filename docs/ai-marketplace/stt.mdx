# Speech To Text

The API is highly scalable and supports a range of audio formats. Developers can choose between two primary API options based on the length of the audio input and the use case:

## Synchronous API

Synchronous API returns the recognized text for short audio **(less than 5 minutes)**.

To process a speech recognition request for audio longer than 5 minutes, use Asynchronous API.

```mdx-code-block
import LinkCard from '../../src/components/LinkCard';

<LinkCard title={"Synchronous API"}  href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/synchronous-api"} />
```

<hr />

## Asynchronous API

Asynchronous API starts a long running audio processing operation. Use asynchronous API to transcribe audio that is **longer than 5 minutes**. The upper limit for asynchronous API is **300 minutes**.

For shorter audio, synchronous API is faster and simpler. The upper limit for asynchronous API is 300 minutes.

```mdx-code-block
<LinkCard title={"Asynchronous API"}  href={"/docs/ai-marketplace/speech-to-text/asynchronous"} />
